Hi! I am a senior undergraduate at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. I major in computer science and technology at School of Electronic and Information Engineering and will be graduating in July, 2025. I am looking for a CS PhD position starting in fall 2026.

Research Overview
======
My primary research interest lies in learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the science
of neural language models. Recently, I focus on model interpretability and inference-time algorithms for Large
Language Models (LLMs). I aim to contribute to the development of safer and more transparent AI systems.
